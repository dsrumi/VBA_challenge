# VBA_challenge
This repository analyses stock data using VBA.The data consists of multiple sheets. We created a code using VBA which loops through all th ticker labels for stocks on all sheets at once and analyses the data giving us outputs in the form of quarterly change,percent change and total volume for each ticker label.
Conditional formatting was done using green and red colors to highlight positive and negative changes in quarterly and percent change for each ticker label.
Data was then furthur analysed greatest increase,greatest decrease and greatest total volume of stocks for each quarter.
